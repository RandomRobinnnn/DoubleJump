I am providing the code in this repository to help others improve their plugins, and even though I want you to be as free as possible with this code, there are just a few things you must be aware of. Here are a couple simple "rules" I want you to follow:

What you can do:

- You may use this code in any of your plugins
- You may use this code to make a profit (In servers or selling your own plugins using code from this repository)

What you must do:
- Give credit where credit is due; Create a link to this repository in the comments of the source code where (parts of) the code from this repository is used (even when modified)

What you can't do:
